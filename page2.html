          Video Games

            >I love most videogames and have been playing them from a very young
            age. Videogames are my main form of entertainment and stress relief.
            My favorite type of games are ones that are extremely difficult.
            This makes completeing them feel even more worth the
            accomplishment</small

            >I watch tons of anime of all different genres. My favorite anime
            has been One Piece for a very long time and it continues to be which
            each new episode. Anime has really been a good recreational activity
            in my life and something I can talk and relate to with my
            friends.</small

          Snowboarding
          <br />
          <small>
            Before moving away from the mountains in 2018 I used to go
            snowboarding every winter. Snowboarding was a great pastime I got to
            enjoy growing up in the mountains of Pennsylvania that I do miss now
            living in the south. Hopefully soon I will get to take a trip and go
            snowboard again.
