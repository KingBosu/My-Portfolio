        >My name is William McKay, I am 31 years old and live in North Carolina.
        I grew up in the Pocono Mountains where I spent all of my childhood and
        the beginning of my adult life. After moving to North Carolina I was
        continually unsure about what I wanted to do next in life and have
        worked many different types of jobs such as
        <ul>
          <li>Security</li>
          <li>Satellite Technician</li>
          <li>Produce Associate</li>
          <li>Mobile Retail Sales</li>
          <li>Repair Technician</li>
        </ul>
        However through doing those things I learned that I was always seeking
        something that would make me feel more fulfilled. I have a decent amount
        of close friends many of whom are also into careers that deal with some
        type of technology and the lifestyles they tend to live seemed more like
        the one I desired for myself. Thus thrusting me into the direction of
        seeking to better myself in all ways that I could.
